# Talk: Token Swapping and Robot Pivoting

This repository contains slides and animations for a talk presented at the
[Workshop on Rapid Reconfiguration of Programmable Matter](http://www.self-assembly.net/UCNC2021-prog-matter/)
at the
[19th International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation (UCNC 2021)](https://ucnc2021.cs.aalto.fi/).

The talk mainly presents the results of two 2021 papers:

1. "[Hardness of Token Swapping on Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06707)"
   by Oswin Aichholzer, Erik Demaine, Matias Korman, Jayson Lynch, Anna Lubiw,
   Zuzana Mas, Mikhail Rudoy, Virginia Vassilevska Williams, and Nicole Wein.
2. "[Characterizing Universal Reconfigurability of Modular Pivoting Robots](https://erikdemaine.org/papers/HingedPixels_SoCG2021/)"
   by Hugo Akitaya, Erik Demaine, Andrei Gonczi, Dylan Hendrickson, Adam Hesterberg, Matias Korman, Oliver Korten, Jayson Lynch, Irene Parada, and Vera Sacrist√°n.

See the papers for more details about the results.

The first half of the talk builds on
[these slides about Token Swapping on Trees](https://github.com/edemaine/talk-token-swapping-robot-pivoting).

## Technology: reveal.js + Pug + Stylus + CoffeeScript + SVG Tiler + SVG.js + KaTeX

This repository uses the
[reveal-pug-talk template](https://github.com/edemaine/reveal-pug-talk)
to make slides by combining the following technology (all free and open source):

* [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/): a flexible HTML presentation framework,
  extendable by plugins and themes.  Here we use:
  * [Chalkboard](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/chalkboard):
    enables live drawing annotation on the slides (using pen or touch or mouse)
  * [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) font
* [Pug](https://pugjs.org/): a concise indentation-based notation for HTML,
  which makes it easier to express reveal.js slides,
  and to mix together other languages.  Here we use:
  * [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/): a concise indentation-based notation
    for CSS (styling of HTML)
  * [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/): an indentation-based language
    that compiles to JavaScript
* [SVG Tiler](https://github.com/edemaine/svgtiler):
  a library for converting ASCII art into high-quality SVG graphics
* [SVG.js](https://svgdotjs.github.io/):
  a library that makes it easy to add animations to SVG drawings
* [KaTeX](https://katex.org): a library for translating LaTeX math into HTML
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/): a tool that builds the Pug code into HTML

## Structure

Here's an overview of the individual files and what they do:

* [`gulpfile.coffee`](gulpfile.coffee): Definitions of `build` and `watch`
  rules that run Pug on `index.pug`.
* [`index.pug`](index.pug): Top-level Pug file that calls all other files.
  Defines the top-level structure of the document, but has no slides.
* [`intro.pug`](intro.pug): Title slide
  (included at the start and end of `index.pug`)
* [`tokens.pug`](tokens.pug): First half of the slides, about token swapping.
* [`robots.pug`](robots.pug): Second half of the slides, about pivoting robots.
* [`figures.coffee`](figures.coffee): code to convert ASCII art of modular
  robot configurations in `robots.pug` into SVG Tiler drawings.
  Class `robots` indicates square-grid robots;
  class `hexrobots` indicates hexagonal-grid robots.
* [`tokenswap.coffee`](tokenswap.coffee): SVG.js-based code to implement
  token-swapping animations, enabling `tokens.pug` to define a triggerable
  animation sequence on a slide with a single line:
  ```pug
  .tokenswap.fragment(data-swaps="4,3 4,2 4,1 3,2 3,1 2,1")
  ```
* [`robotpivot.coffee`](robotpivot.coffee): SVG.js-based code to implement
  robot-pivoting animations on top of SVG Tiler drawings from `figures.coffee`.
  This enables `robots.pug` to define a triggerable animation sequence on a
  slide with a single line:
  ```pug
  .robotpivot.fragment(data-target="id", data-pivots="1,5/-180@2,6/-90@3,6 3,1/-180@3,1")
  ```
  Here `data-pivots` gives the coordinates of a tile (such as `1,5` or `3,1`),
  and uses `/angle@coords` to indicate pivoting around a single center.
  In hexagonal examples, the centers can be specified as tile corners via e.g.
  `TL1,5` for the top-left corner of hex with coordinates (1, 5).
* [`gadgets.coffee`](gadgets.coffee): SVG.js-based code to implement a few
  specific animations of traversing the locking 2-toggle gadget.
* [`index.styl`](index.styl): Some custom reveal.js styling,
  and general tools for styling slides.
* [`tokens.styl`](tokens.styl): Styling specific to token swapping,
  including SVG figures.  (Check out the cool glow/shadow effects!)
* [`robots.styl`](tokens.styl): Styling specific to robot pivoting,
  including SVG figures.  (Check out the cool SVG animations!)

* [`L2T_states.svg`](L2T_states.svg): Figure 15(a) from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07556.pdf)
* [`degree1.svg`](degree1.svg): Figure 9 from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07556.pdf)
* [`merge-example.svg`](merge-example.svg): Figure from a future version of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07556.pdf)

## Build Instructions

To build the slides HTML (`index.html`) from the source files:

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the following:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

If you're live-editing the file and want `index.html` to continually build
and update, use the following command:

```sh
npm run watch
```

To assemble just the needed files into a `dist` directory,
use the following command:

```sh
npm run dist
```

To deploy these files to GitHub Pages, use the following command:

```sh
npm run deploy
```
